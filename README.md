!!! It was made for people who store money in their rooms/safe, so they can know who and how much there is, or someone like that. This was NOT made for official banks. 

I wrote a simple bank in Python. To log in, the username is "Owner" with password "123456789", to change it, go to pyBank/data/staff and there to name.txt or password.txt to change it. 
To delete accounts, go to pyBank/data/customers and by ID you can find the person's account, and delete the file.
